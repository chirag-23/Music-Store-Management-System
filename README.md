# Music-Store-Management-System
Managing a music store was not easier in a manual system and the shop owner had to check the stocks of the record manually by himself/herself. It was harder to keep track of the available and sold records in the music store.
This system will be able to perform some tasks like-
1. Add new record in the system
2. Display all the music records
3. Display all the sold records
4. Search record in the system
5. Modify the record details in the system
6. Delete the specific record from the system
